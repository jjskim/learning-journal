# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 2

Today was the first "full" day of Code 201. I think it went well overall and so far, I'm not feeling too overwhelmed or anything. In terms of the lab, it was really tedious to type out the JavaScript for my questions game since we were not allowed to write our own functions. Still, I found the process of repeating the same steps over and over for each question useful for really hammering in the idea that a function would help cut down on all the redundancy.

As for the HTML/CSS part, it was really humbling. Taking classes online through Codeacademy or Udacity, I think HTML and CSS is relatively "easy" to learn, so to speak, but actually executing on your own and making websites that don't end up looking like a fourth-grader drew it with crayons is very difficult, at least for me at this point. I hope I do get better at this -- both in writing out the designs in CSS and laying out the structure via HTML tags.
