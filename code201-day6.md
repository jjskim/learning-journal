# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

I think I feel pretty confident with being able to write functions and objects in JavaScript (up to what I know so far). The main thing that gives me the most trouble and takes the most time is still figuring out how I want to layout my HTML and then styling it how I want with CSS. I'm also a little shaky with exactly how to render values into the DOM, but using my notes as a guide seems to be working so far.

After today, my main goals are to improve in both HTML and CSS, and make sure I memorize and understand the process to write elements to the DOM.
