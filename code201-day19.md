# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 19

Project week has almost wrapped up and I'm pretty relieved that everything went relatively well. My group members have all been great and they've all been doing so much work trying to improve the project that I was motivated in turn. That being said, I did feel like working as a group in person everyday did get to be a bit distracting at times, as there were days when I honestly just wanted to work alone so I could work without interruptions and finish things that I wanted sooner. Still, I understand working as a group is an important part of any job so I'm glad that I'm getting the opportunity to practice that here. Tomorrow is presentation day and I'm honestly a bit nervous. The practice presentation went fine as it was only to a small group, but knowing that the crowd will be much larger tomorrow makes me a bit worried if I'll be able to keep a calm head. Overall, I'm feeling a lot of things -- relieved that project week is over, a bit disappointed that I didn't get to all of my stretch goals, I don't know. This class as a whole has been a great experience and I'm glad I decided to go through with it.
