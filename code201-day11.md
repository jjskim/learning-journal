# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 11

Monday was a build up day for the BusMall project. The lab didn't really have many new concepts or things to learn or test out, but the fact that we were building it from scratch using things we have learned in the past few weeks made it more challenging than the previous labs. Like for example, Salmon Cookies started with us just hard coding the stores one by one, and then using object constructors to tidy our code. BusMall instead had us begin with object constructors, so it was more challenging figuring out what variables, arrays, and properties we wanted to include in our objects. I have to say that one thing I really found valuable was spending about 30 minutes to an hour to just write down and plan out the program. Even though I started writing actual code later, the fact that I had a plan made the process much easier and I will definitely be doing it moving forward.
