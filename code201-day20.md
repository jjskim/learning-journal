# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 20

Today was the last day of class and we all presented our final projects. I have mixed feelings -- I'm disappointed that I didn't get to all of the stretch goals I wanted, but I'm also definitely happy to have finished the project at all and presented it to the school. Gabe and Thomas are both great guys and easy to work with, neither of them have very strong personalities so I think that really helped all of us foster a team environment that felt safe for each of us. I'm looking forward to taking a short break and I'm excited for 301 to start.
