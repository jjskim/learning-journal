# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 17

It's the middle of project week and I feel pretty happy with what all of us have accomplished. Gabe and Thomas have been great group members and have both been working on adding a lot of extra feature and functionality. I think at this point we have a MVP ready to publish and present, but we're all still working on adding additional features and making the game look nicer. I've really been impressed with all the work Gabe and Thomas have put in, especially after class hours, so I've been motivated to keep up and contribute my fair share.
