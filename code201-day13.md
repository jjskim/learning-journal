# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 13

Today we learned about persistence and local storage. I'm interested to see how we can use this in the future to create more interesting and interactive web applications. I know that one of the requirements for the final project is to show persistence and/or use local storage, so I'm interested to learn as much as I can about it in the coming days in order to prepare for the final project.
